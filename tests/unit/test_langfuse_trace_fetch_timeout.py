"""Issue #540: the Langfuse trace fetch must not block a task for minutes.

``LangfuseTraceHandler.get_langfuse_data`` is awaited inline in the per-task
eval path (``src/cuga/evaluation/evaluate_cuga.py:159``), so every second it
spends retrying is wall-clock added to the task before its result is returned.

Issue #318 added a fast path for *missing credentials*. These tests cover the
case that is still live: credentials are present but the Langfuse server does
not answer -- an unreachable host, a wrong port, or a trace that has not
propagated yet. The retry loop in ``extract_langfuse_data`` then runs its full
backoff schedule (2, 3, 4.5, 6.75, 10.1, 15.2, 22.8, 34.2, 51.3 = ~150s)
before giving up.

No Langfuse server, no API key and no network access are needed. The tests
point the client at a closed loopback port, which refuses instantly, and drive
the backoff on a virtual clock so the blocking cost is measured without being
spent.
